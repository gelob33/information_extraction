##### **What is covered by this policy**


<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Cover for your motorcycle</span>


**<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Your motorcycle is covered for any accidental physical loss or damage that occurs during the period of cover anywhere in</span>**
**New Zealand (including in transit between places in New Zealand).**


<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">There are some circumstances when you are not covered – please refer to ‘What is not covered by this policy’ on page 5 and the
Policy Schedule.</span>


**Important information for Third Party policyholders:**


<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">This section does not apply if your motorcycle is insured under a Third Party policy.</span></span> The only cover you have under a Third Party
policy is ‘Cover for your legal liability’ _(see page 3 – 4)._ <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">If you have a Third Party policy, this will be stated in the Policy Schedule.</span>


**What we will pay** **a.** <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">If your motorcycle is damaged and can be repaired, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">we will pay to repair it to substantially the same
condition it was in before the damage occurred.</span></span>


**b.** If a part or accessory is not available in New Zealand we will pay either:


i the manufacturer’s last known list price in New Zealand, or


ii the price of the part’s closest New Zealand equivalent, or


iii the cost of having the part made in New Zealand,


whichever is the lesser.


**c.** <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">If your motorcycle is damaged beyond economic or safe repair, or if your motorcycle is stolen and
not recovered, then we will pay you an amount up to the market value of your motorcycle.</span> If this
happens, you must transfer ownership of your motorcycle to us.


**What we won’t pay** **a.** <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">We will not pay to replace any part that was not damaged.</span>


**b.** We will not pay to airfreight parts to New Zealand from overseas.


**c.** <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">We will only pay for the repainting of areas that actually suffered damage in the event claimed for.</span>


**d.** <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">We will</span> do our best to make sure that the repairer matches existing paint. If the repairer has been
unable to match the existing paintwork, then <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">we will not pay to repaint undamaged areas.</span>


Cover for additional costs


**<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">We will pay for the following additional costs if we agree to pay a claim for loss of or damage to your motorcycle.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">This**
**section does not apply if your motorcycle is insured under a Third Party policy.**


**Motorcycle removal** **a.** If your motorcycle is damaged so that it is unable to be ridden we will pay <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">all reasonable costs to
move it to the nearest repairer or another secure place.</span></span></span>


**b.** If your motorcycle is stolen and then found, we will pay <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the cost of returning it to the place it was
stolen from, or to another place we agree on with you.</span>


**Transport home** **a.** <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">This cover only applies to policies in the name of a person or persons and not a corporate body.</span>


**b.** If you are away from your home and you are unable to return because your motorcycle has been
stolen or damaged we will reimburse you for:


i the reasonable costs, not otherwise insured, of transporting yourself and any passenger
home, and


ii the reasonable costs of returning your motorcycle to your home within New Zealand.


**Legal defence** **a.** This cover applies if we agree to pay a claim under ‘Cover for your motorcycle’ above or ‘Cover for
your legal liability’ on page 3.


**b.** <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">This cover only applies to policies in the name of a person or persons and not a corporate body.</span>
